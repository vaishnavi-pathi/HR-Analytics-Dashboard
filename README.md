## Problem Statement

This HR Analytics Dashboard is designed to provide insights into employee attrition andjob satisfaction. Employee attrition is a significant challenge for HR departments, impacting productivity, team morale, and operational costs. This dashboard gives HR leaders and stakeholders a comprehensive view of employee retention patterns, satisfaction levels, and demographic factors influencing attrition. By analyzing these metrics, the HR team can develop targeted strategies to improve retention, enhance job satisfaction, and make informed decisions regarding workforce planning and employee engagement.


## Key Features of the Dashboard

**High-Level Metrics Summary:** Employee Count, Attrition Count, Active Employees, Attrition Rate, and Average Age are displayed prominently at the top of the dashboard, providing a quick overview of the companyâ€™s workforce and attrition situation.

**Attrition by Gender:** A lollipop chart shows attrition numbers by gender, providing a quick overview of gender distribution in attrition. This insight helps HR evaluate whether attrition is gender-skewed and consider gender-specific engagement strategies if necessary.

**Attrition by Department:** A pie chart showing department-wise attrition distribution. This chart highlights which departments have the highest attrition rates, allowing HR to focus retention efforts on the most affected departments.

**Employee Age Distribution:** A histogram representing the number of employees by age group, which helps identify the age demographics of the workforce. This data can help HR understand which age groups may require tailored engagement or retention programs.

**Job Satisfaction by Job Role:** A matrix with job satisfaction ratings (from 1 to 4) segmented by job role. This feature provides insights into the satisfaction levels of employees in various positions, helping HR identify roles with lower satisfaction and prioritize improvement efforts.

**Attrition by Education Field:** A bar chart displaying attrition rates segmented by employees' field of education, highlighting which educational backgrounds are associated with higher attrition. This information can help HR departments develop customized retention strategies based on educational background.

**Attrition Rate by Gender Across Age Groups:** A set of donut charts showing the attrition rate by gender within different age groups. This breakdown helps to identify if certain age and gender combinations have higher attrition, enabling targeted retention initiatives.

## Insights

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard:

### [1] Department-Wise Attrition:
The R&D department has the highest attrition rate at 56.12%, followed by Sales at 38.82% and HR at 5.06%. This suggests potential issues within R&D, such as job satisfaction, workload, or lack of career progression.

### [2] Age Distribution and Attrition Risk:

The age group 25-34 has the largest number of employees, followed closely by the 35-44 age group, both of which also show higher attrition rates. Attrition is particularly high in the Under 25 group, suggesting that younger employees or those early in their careers are more likely to leave, potentially due to unmet career expectations or better opportunities elsewhere. In contrast, attrition decreases significantly in older age groups, such as 45-54 and Over 55, where stability and career satisfaction may be higher, indicating a more settled workforce with fewer immediate career transition plans.

### [3] Job Satisfaction Variability by Role:

Roles like Sales Executive and Research Scientist show higher satisfaction levels, while roles like Human Resources, Healthcare Representative and Research Director have lower satisfaction ratings. This indicates that certain job roles may be more fulfilling or better aligned with employee expectations.

### [4] Attrition by Gender:

Males have a higher attrition count (150) compared to females (87). Males also show a higher attrition rate than females in all age groups, particularly in the 25-34 range. This could signal that younger male employees are more inclined to leave, which may indicate that this demographic has specific needs that are not being met.


### [5] Education Fields and Attrition:

Employees from Life Sciences (89) and Medical backgrounds (63) have the highest attrition numbers. This could suggest that employees with these educational backgrounds have better opportunities elsewhere or face unique challenges within the organization.

### [6] Overall Attrition Rate:

With an overall attrition rate of 16.12%, there is room for improvement in retention strategies. This rate suggests that over 1 in 6 employees leaves the organization, which could impact continuity, team morale, and productivity.

## Conclusion: 
By focusing on high-attrition departments, providing tailored support for different demographics, enhancing job satisfaction, and using targeted retention strategies, the company can work towards reducing its attrition rate and building a more engaged and stable workforce.
